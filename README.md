This project is a frontend practice challenge from [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/), aimed at improving my frontend skills and applying the knowledge I have acquired so far. The goal was to create a responsive and user-friendly application while experimenting with modern web technologies like **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Material UI**.

By working on this challenge, I focused on refining my ability to build scalable components, maintain clean code, and optimize performance. It provided a great opportunity to reinforce my existing skills and keep up with the latest practices in frontend development.

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on staying current with modern tools and technologies. I applied **Atomic Design** for creating scalable components and embraced **TypeScript** to ensure type safety. I also used **React** and **Material UI** to build a responsive and user-friendly interface.

I incorporated **CSS custom properties**, **Flexbox**, and **styled-components** for flexible and maintainable styling. To ensure code quality, I set up **linters**, **Prettier**, and **Husky** for automated checks. I also optimized package management with **pnpm** and handled data fetching with **Axios**.

This project allowed me to stay up to date with industry best practices and improve my development workflow.
